# Editors

## Text Editors
Every JBMod user should have access to a text editor. Here are some good ones:

* Notepad++
* VSCode
* C:\Windows\notepad.exe
* Writing it down on a sheet of paper, and then scanning it with your phone.
* Using an 8-bit microcomputer to copy the text to cassette tape, and then playing it back through a JBL bluetooth speaker.

## Map Editors
There are only two map editors.

* Hammer++
* JBMod's built in version of Hammer Editor

## Misc
There are a few extra tools some JBMod users may need when creating content.

* Blender
* VTFEdit
* paint.net (even doe this could've been put in an independent section about image editors)
* Aseprite (gibsonkidd's official endorsement of an image editor. used for pixel art but is good for precise edits and making art easily)
* GCFScape
* Xampp (why?)
* Audacity
* Crowbar
