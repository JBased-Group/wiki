## Publishing to STEAM Workshop

Open Crowbar, then go to the Publish tab at the top.
If you don't have crowbar you can easily get it from [here!][https://github.com/ZeqMacaw/Crowbar/releases/download/v0.74/Crowbar_2023-02-16_0.74.7z]

1. Select JBMod in the Game tab, choose your Game Type and Content Type (found on the side).
2. Add your Title and Description; the Change note doesn't really matter.
3. Select the folder where your content is located.
     If you're publishing a map, the folder must look like this:
	(This applies to models as well, except the maps folder should be models)
	``` - <Folder> 
		 - maps 
		  - map.bsp ```
4. Choose a Preview image with a screenshot or image of the content you're publishing.
5. Change the Visibility to Public.
6. Select Publish.
	If prompted to accept the STEAM Subscriber Agreement, do so.

And you're done!
