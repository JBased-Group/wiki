# Plugins

Server plugins for JBMod can do quite a lot more than what regular old Hammer Logic does.

For instance, direct control over every entity in the map, spouting out text for users to read, modifying behaviors of certain entities, etc.

## How to Install Plugins on Your Server

This is assuming you have already read the [[Server Hosting/Server Hosting Basics]] and have set up a server of your own. We advise not to continue unless you have done so.

1. Download [Metamod:Source][https://www.metamodsource.net/]
2. Download [SourceMod][https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php?branch=stable]
3. Extract them to the `<JBMOD SRCDS LOCATION>/jbmod/addons/` folder

That's it. When you start your server, SourceMod will be loaded.

To add plugins to your server, put them in `<JBMOD SRCDS LOCATION>/jbmod/addons/sourcemod/plugins/` folder.
