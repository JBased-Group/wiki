# Server Hosting Basics

## Requirements for Hosting
The requirements for hosting a server may sound heavy at first, but you likely already have everything you need if you're a JBMod power-user.

The mandatory requirements for hosting a server are as follows:
* A computer. This can range from as something as high-tech as your gaming PC with 128 gb ram, 10 ghz cpu, and RTX 9090 all the way down to your grandma's shitty Core 2 Duo laptop running Windows Vista. All that matters is that it's running Windows or Linux.
* Free access to your router. This means that you can log into your router, change settings if needed, and most importantly open and close ports.
* Essential software. You should probably have Steam, SteamCMD, Half-Life 2, JBMod, and JBMod Dedicated Server all installed on your computer.

Some non-essential but recommended requirements for hosting a server are as follows:
* Direct connection from your computer to your router via an ethernet cable
* A basic knowledge on how all the components of the Source Engine work
